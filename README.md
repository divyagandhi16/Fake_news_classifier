In todayâ€™s digital age, misinformation has become a
 major concern, particularly with the rapid spread of fake
 news on platforms like social media, websites, and
 other online sources. Misinformation can influence
 public opinion, distort reality, compromise social
 stability, and impact important decision-making
 processes in areas like health, politics, and economics.
 The challenge is exacerbated by the ease with which
 false or misleading information can be shared and
 amplified across digital networks.
 The aim is to classify news articles/posts into real and
 fake categories based on textual content, providing a
 framework to combat misinformation and foster trust in
 digital information.
